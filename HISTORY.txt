Some early tests.

Test competition submission.

 - max_work      = 10'000'000
 - max_enumerate =    100'000
 - max_analyze   =      2'000

No work limits for Analyze(). No time limits. Typically finishes games in
about 2 seconds.

Small logging bug: inverts the meaning of the '+' sign when printing solutions:
100+ solutions is printed as "100", exactly 42 solutions is printed as "42+".

Fixed logging bug. Increased max_analyze to 10'000.
